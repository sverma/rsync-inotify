Rsync script based on inotify and some perl not so magic.  
 It syncs up your servers local directories to multiple servers  based on two time periods , sleep_period and trigger period . 
 
sleep period determines the time interval in which the script wakes up the check the monitored directory for any changes , if it gets any changes it issues a rsync command based on the configuration . trigger_period defines the global time period in which rsync runs irrespective of the changes in the monitored directory. 

EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION : 

   <head>
        <servsync name="test_shared">
            <localpath watch='/u/shared-data/' exclude='access-logs,cache,check_avail_abuse,pgfoundationapi/logs'/>
             <remote ip='bigrock-in-2.myserver.com' name='test_shared' />
             <rsync options='-avz -u --delete -e ssh' user='root' />
             <trigger options="mail,rsync" period="20"/>
        </servsync>
   </head>

servsync section's "name" attribute defines the remote "RSYNC DAEMON MODULE NAME" , Currently this script expects to have a rsync daemon running on remote servers and with proper daemon module names . More on this at rsync man page "USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION"

You can have different servsync sections in a particular configuration depending on how many local directories you want to sync up with the remote rsync location . 
   Each servsync path can have multiple comma separated remote IPs/Hostname . Rsync will run every "period" in trigger parameter .trigger parameter in modulable , so you can put up your module ( perl module ) to include things like mail , scp , jabber client , notification etc . By default it ships with only rsync. Next release might have mail module. 
   so every 20 secs  ( sleep_period ) scripts wakes up to check '/u/shared-data/' and if it finds any changes it sync it to bigrock-in-2.myserver.com::test_shared , here test_shared in a rsync module name on the remote server . you need to define this on your remote servers in /etc/rsyncd.conf  , For example : 

   [test_shared]
   path= /u/shared-data/
   comment = test shared bigrock html contents
   ignore errors
   read only = no

   Irrespecive of changes , the script will rsync based on period attribute of trigger parameter . 
   It will issue the following command 
   /usr/bin/rsync -avz -u --delete -e ssh --exclude access-logs --exclude cache --exclude check_avail_abuse --exclude pgfoundationapi/logs /u/shared-data/ root@bigrock-in-2.myserver.com::test_shared

   Things to do in next draft: 

   A.) Support for async triggers based on epoll 
   B.) Mail trrigger , 
   C.) Better logging and debugging.
   D.) init startup and syslog scripts  

   How to run the script: 

   Things to be checked : 
   A.) Password less ssh to the remote servers 
   B.) User should have the permission on remote servers to accept updates or to the logging file you provide 
   C.) rsyncd.conf should be updated 

INSTALLATION: 

   Install the RPM rsync-inotify , rum the following command with the user you desire to rsync 
   perl sync_path.pl [--daemonize] [--config_loc] [--log_loc] [--sleep_period] [--help]

   --daemonize : Will daemonize the script 
   --config_loc : default location of the config file is /opt/rsync-inotify/servsync_conf.xml 
   --log_loc : defaults to /var/log/rsync-inotify/sync.log , verfiy that the user has write permission to log file 
   --slep_period: interval in which script wakes to check for the local directory changes 
   --help : print this help
